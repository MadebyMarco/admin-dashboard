A practice of using grid and flex box to create appealing layouts.

I learned that when I imported my svgs as an image, I couldn't change the color through css, but I could through it's svg code.

Im also figuring out that flex box is much more difficult when there are lots of items at many different sizes. I think grid so far has been much easier to use for almost everything. I am still implementing flex box to improve it my skills with it.
